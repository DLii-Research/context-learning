# Context-Learning (cTL)

This research introduces a new neurobiologically-inspired deep learning framework for autonomous context learning. This framework is compatible with Tensorflow Keras to allow simple integration of context learning/switching mechanisms inspired from working memory research and models into typical neural network architectures.
