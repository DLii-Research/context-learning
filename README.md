# Context-Learning (cTL)

This research introduces a new neurobiologically-inspired deep learning framework for autonomous context learning. This framework is compatible with Tensorflow Keras to allow simple integration of context learning/switching mechanisms inspired from working memory research and models into typical neural network architectures.

The paper is available on IEEE Xplore: [A Neurobiologically-inspired Framework for Autonomous Context Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9643379)
